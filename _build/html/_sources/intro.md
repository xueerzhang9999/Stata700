# Welcome to Xueer's Stata Program Book

Welcome to Xueer's Stata program book. This book serves as a guide to a set of Stata programs our group developed as part of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) project.

## Introduction

The primary purpose of this book is to facilitate the understanding and use of these Stata programs. The book includes detailed explanations of each program, along with examples of their use.
